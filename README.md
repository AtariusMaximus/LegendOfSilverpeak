LoSsk is the AtariVox SaveKey Utility I wrote for this game.  display the SaveKey values that Legend of Silverpeak saves to memory.  It will allow you to check the save game (to verify your level, amount of gold, etc). It is for real hardware only as the AtariVox is not currently emulated in software.
